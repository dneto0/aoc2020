# David's Advent of Code 2020

[Inspired](https://www.duskborn.com/posts/aoc2020/) and [challenged](https://twitter.com/sheredom/status/1333874669565435904)
by [Neil Henning](https://github.com/sheredom), I've made this repo to
hold my [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)
solutions, just like [he has](https://github.com/sheredom/AOC2020).

But I'm going to do them in [Perl](https://www.perl.org/).
Perl was my tool of choice when working at startups in the dot-com days.
Man alive, it's powerful, and the [community](https://www.cpan.org/) is terrific.
